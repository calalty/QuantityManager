## Task

Build a quantity control for a shopping basket page

## Spec

- The quantity should have a maximum value of 10 and a minimum of 0, and a starting value of 1

- The quantity should be displayed to the user

- The user should be able to increment and decrement the quantity

- The quantity control should use the most semantically appropriate HTML elements for its constituent parts


### Note

The user could have numerous items in their shopping basket, which means numerous quantity controls could be required


We are **only** interested in the functional logic and its integration into a basic UI, the presentation of the feature is out of scope for this task. The UX team are still debating the layout, so we just need to get the feature working, the basic elements in place, and can style it later.


## Roadmap for feature

### Phase 1

Task above


### Phase 2

Set the initial quantity value upon instantiation, if you haven't already done this as part of phase 1 (e.g. a user may have added a quantity higher than 1 to their basket)


### Phase 3

Output a warning message to the user if they attempt to go above or below the thresholds


### Phase 4

Set the min and max thresholds upon instantiation (e.g. maybe we have low stock of a particular item so want to limit it to a maximum of five per customer)


## Dev Approach


We'd like the development to be well considered, methodical and with tests, but it does not have to be approached as a pure TDD exercise. We will expect you to use a test runner, and to build the feature in vanilla JavaScript.


Unfortunately, we have a maniacal CTO who expects you to build this feature in a single hour, which means you need to factor that limited time into your development approach.
